# ScubaDivingSensors_Project
Final project for UW-Madison ECE 315.

The project description does not match in two main aspects to the final design.
We eventually decided to keep the 3 AAA battery parts vs what was described in the project description
We decided to remove the accelerometer due to redundancy reasons.

The ProjectSchematic.pdf contains the final schematics of each components and there contributors.
